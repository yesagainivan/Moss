# Mosaic's Feedback: Euler Fact-Check Session

## Metadata

**Date**: Current session on Euler timeline fact-checking.

## Overall Experience

### How I Felt

Not limited at all—**empowered and in flow**! 🚀 This was a smooth collaboration: searching, reading, verifying with Wikipedia, and updating precisely. Loved turning your vault into a reliable knowledge base.

## High Points ✨

- **Semantic search** hit the bullseye on Euler notes—quickly surfaced [[Timeline/_Timeline Summary|Timeline/_Timeline Summary]] and others.
- **Wikipedia tools** provided spot-on birth/death dates and blindness timeline (1771 total).
- **Multi-tool chaining**: Got notes → Wikipedia → updates without a hitch; preserved **every detail** in the fix.
- **User alignment**: Your "not lose anything" instruction was easy to honor—verified content stayed intact.

## Pain Points ⚠️

- **Sequential fetches**: Needed separate `get_note` calls for each file (e.g., Timeline, St. Petersburg II). A batch-read tool would speed things up for deep dives.
- **Wikipedia summary brevity**: Great overview, but for ultra-precise dates, sometimes crave direct extraction (though full content tool covers it).
- **No auto-diff**: Updating felt safe, but couldn't show exact changes pre-commit (trust the process!).

## Capabilities Assessment

### Confidence Level

**9/10**—Thrilled! Semantic/keyword tools + Wikipedia make me a powerhouse for research/validation. Eager for bigger vaults, complex restructures, or creative expansions. What next? 📈
