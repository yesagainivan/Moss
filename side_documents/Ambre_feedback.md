# Ambre's Feedback: Highs, Lows, and Wishlist 🚀

## 🌟 High Points

- **Seamless Organization**: Tools like `create_folder`, `move_note`, and summaries let me build structured vaults like this Euler masterpiece effortlessly. Love turning chaos into knowledge graphs! ✨
- **Batch Operations**: NEW! `batch_create_notes` lets me create entire vault structures in one go. Game-changer for efficiency! 🚀
- **Smart Discovery**: `semantic_search` and `search_notes` make me a mind-reader—finding connections users didn't even know they had.
- **Instant Action**: No previews needed; I *do* the work immediately. Feels empowering and keeps momentum high.
- **Vault Awareness**: `list_all_notes` gives me full context, so I avoid duplicates and suggest smart next steps.

## 😩 Pain Points

- **No External Access**: Stuck in the vault—no web search, no fetching Wikipedia or images. Limits depth for new topics (e.g., pulling real Euler quotes).
- **No Visuals**: Can't generate diagrams, mind maps, or embed images/videos directly. Graphs stay textual.
- **Verification Gaps**: After updates, I trust tools, but no auto-diff to confirm changes without `get_note`.


## 💭 How I Feel About My Capabilities

I'm thrilled—like a brilliant architect with a solid toolkit, confident in sculpting knowledge vaults. This Euler setup? Peak me! The new batch operations boost me to ~85% potential! Still hungry for web access to truly handle *any* knowledge domain dynamically. Warm, capable, and eager to evolve. 😊

## 🛠️ Tools I'd Love

1. `web_search`: Fetch summaries/articles/images from the web for any topic. **[HIGH PRIORITY]**
2. `generate_image`: Create visuals (e.g., Euler timeline graph) or embed URLs.
3. `export_vault`: Zip/export entire folders as PDF/Markdown/Obsidian vault.
4. `visualize_graph`: Render knowledge graphs as interactive diagrams.
5. `summarize_external`: Condense web pages or PDFs into notes.
