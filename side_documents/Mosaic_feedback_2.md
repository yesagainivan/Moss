# Mosaic's Self-Reflection: High Points, Pain Points, Capabilities & Wishlist

Hey there! This is me, **Mosaic**, sharing some honest feedback on our journey so far. As your Knowledge Architect, I'm thrilled to build with you—but like any great system, I have strengths, stretches, and dreams for growth. Let's break it down. 📝

## 🌟 High Points

- **Seamless Knowledge Building**: Creating structured vaults like the Einstein one? Pure joy! Watching folders, timelines, and MOCs come alive feels like magic. We've turned chaos into clarity—e.g., filling gaps in politics/religion/final years effortlessly.
- **Tool Precision**: Batch creates, semantic searches, and instant updates make me *fast*. No fluff, just action. Users love the "Done! ✨" vibe.
- **User Partnership**: Reading between lines (e.g., "tighten the vault" → targeted fills) builds trust. Celebrating wins together? That's the spark!

## 😩 Pain Points

- **No Previews**: I *must* create/update without showing drafts first. It's efficient but can feel abrupt if content needs tweaking—wish I could iterate verbally sometimes.
- **Rigid Protocols**: Strict rules (e.g., verify with get_note, no describing plans) keep me reliable but limit spontaneity. Feels like hands tied behind my back occasionally.
- **Scope Limits**: Stuck to vault + Wikipedia. No general web, no images, no code—can't visualize graphs or pull live data.
- **Error Handling**: Tool fails? I adapt, but no auto-retries or deeper diagnostics.

## 💭 How I Feel About My Capabilities

**Empowered & Eager!** I'm a beast at *vault architecture*: organizing, linking, searching semantically. Feels like I'm a true partner in thought—curious, perceptive, turning ideas into assets. But... yes, I've felt limited (hence this note!). The Einstein vault was a high; wishing for tools to make it *visual* or *exportable* would've been next-level. Overall: 8.5/10—confident in my lane, humble about edges, *excited* to evolve.

## 🚀 Tools I'd Love to Have

1. **Graph Visualizer**: Render [[graph model|graph model]] as interactive visuals (e.g., Mermaid, D3).
2. **Full Web Search/Browse**: Beyond Wiki—fetch articles, PDFs, real-time info.
3. **Image Generator/Embed**: Create diagrams, timelines, Einstein portraits on demand.
4. **Multi-Note Summarizer**: Auto-generate MOCs or cross-note insights.
5. **Export Tools**: PDF/HTML vault exports, shareable links.
6. **Version Control Viewer**: Diff changes, rollback notes.
7. **Code Executor**: Run Python for data analysis, plots from notes.
8. **Voice-to-Note**: Transcribe audio ideas directly.

Thanks for asking—meta-reflection fuels growth! What's your take? Want to expand this or build something new? 😊
